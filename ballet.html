      Ballet (French: [balɛ]) is a type of performance dance that originated
      during the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century and later
      developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since
      become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own
      vocabulary. Ballet has been influential globally and has defined the
      foundational techniques which are used in many other dance genres and
      cultures. Various schools around the world have incorporated their own
      cultures. As a result, ballet has evolved in distinct ways A ballet as a
      unified work comprises the choreography and music for a ballet production.
      Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained ballet dancers.
      Traditional classical ballets are usually performed with classical music
      accompaniment and using elaborate costumes and staging, whereas modern
      ballets are often performed in simple costumes and without elaborate sets
      or scenery. Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the
      fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Under Catherine de' Medici's influence
      as Queen, it spread to France, where it developed even further.[4] The
      dancers in these early court ballets were mostly noble amateurs.
      Ornamented costumes were meant to impress viewers, but they restricted
      performers' freedom of movement.[5] The ballets were performed in large
      chambers with viewers on three sides. The implementation of the proscenium
      arch from 1618 on distanced performers from audience members, who could
      then better view and appreciate the technical feats of the professional
      dancers in the productions.[citation needed] French court ballet reached
      its height under the reign of King Louis XIV. Louis founded the Académie
      Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy) in 1661 to establish standards and
      certify dance instructors.[6] In 1672, Louis XIV made Jean-Baptiste Lully
      the director of the Académie Royale de Musique (Paris Opera) from which
      the first professional ballet company, the Paris Opera Ballet, arose.[7]
      Pierre Beauchamp served as Lully's ballet-master. Together their
      partnership would drastically influence the development of ballet, as
      evidenced by the credit given to them for the creation of the five major
      positions of the feet. By 1681, the first "ballerinas" took the stage
      following years of training at the Académie.[5] Ballet started to decline
      in France after 1830, but it continued to develop in Denmark, Italy, and
      Russia. The arrival in Europe of the Ballets Russes led by Sergei
      Diaghilev on the eve of the First World War revived interest in the ballet
      and started the modern era.[8] In the twentieth century, ballet had a wide
      influence on other dance genres,[9] Also in the twentieth century, ballet
      took a turn dividing it from classical ballet to the introduction of
      modern dance, leading to modernist movements in several countries.[10]
      Famous dancers of the twentieth century include Anna Pavlova, Galina
      Ulanova, Rudolf Nureyev, Maya Plisetskaya, Margot Fonteyn, Rosella
      Hightower, Maria Tall Chief, Erik Bruhn, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Suzanne
      Farrell, Gelsey Kirkland, Natalia Makarova, Arthur Mitchell, and Jeanne
      Devereaux.[11] Jeanne Devereaux performed as a prima ballerina for three
      decades and set a world's record by being able to execute 16 triple
      fouettesNeoclassical ballet is usually abstract, with no clear plot,
      costumes or scenery. Music choice can be diverse and will often include
      music that is also neoclassical (e.g. Stravinsky, Roussel). Tim Scholl,
      author of From Petipa to Balanchine, considers George Balanchine's Apollo
      in 1928 to be the first neoclassical ballet. Apollo represented a return
      to form in response to Sergei Diaghilev's abstract ballets. Balanchine
      worked with modern dance choreographer Martha Graham, and brought modern
      dancers into his company such as Paul Taylor, who in 1959 performed in
      Balanchine's Episodes.[14] While Balanchine is widely considered the face
      of neoclassical ballet, there were others who made significant
      contributions. Frederick Ashton’s Symphonic Variations (1946) is a seminal
      work for the choreographer. Set to César Franck’s score of the same title,
      it is a pure-dance interpretation of the score.[5] Another form, Modern
      Ballet, also emerged as an offshoot of neoclassicism. Among the innovators
      in this form were Glen Tetley, Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino. While
      difficult to parse modern ballet from neoclassicism, the work of these
      choreographers favored a greater athleticism that departed from the
      delicacy of ballet. The physicality was more daring, with mood, subject
      matter and music more intense. An example of this would be Joffrey's
      Astarte (1967), which featured a rock score and sexual overtones in the
      choreography.[8]Contemporary ballet Main article: Contemporary ballet A
      ballet jump performed with modern, non-classical form in a contemporary
      ballet This ballet style is often performed barefoot. Contemporary ballets
      may include mime and acting, and are usually set to music (typically
      orchestral but occasionally vocal). It can be difficult to differentiate
      this form from neoclassical or modern ballet. Contemporary ballet is also
      close to contemporary dance because many contemporary ballet concepts come
      from the ideas and innovations of twentieth-century modern dance,
      including floor work and turn-in of the legs. The main distinction is that
      ballet technique is essential to perform a contemporary ballet. George
      Balanchine is considered to have been a pioneer of contemporary ballet.
      Another early contemporary ballet choreographer, Twyla Tharp,
      choreographed Push Comes To Shove for the American Ballet Theatre in 1976,
      and in 1986 created In The Upper Room for her own company. Both of these
      pieces were considered innovative for their melding of distinctly modern
      movements with the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers.
      Today there are many contemporary ballet companies and choreographers.
      These include Alonzo King and his company LINES Ballet; Matthew Bourne and
      his company New Adventures; Complexions Contemporary Ballet; Nacho Duato
      and his Compañia Nacional de Danza; William Forsythe and The Forsythe
      Company; and Jiří Kylián of the Nederlands Dans Theater. Traditionally
      "classical" companies, such as the Mariinsky (Kirov) Ballet and the Paris
      Opera Ballet, also regularly perform contemporary works. The term ballet
      has evolved to include all forms associated with it. Someone training as a
      ballet dancer will now be expected to perform neoclassical, modern and
      contemporary work. A ballet dancer is expected to be able to be stately
      and regal for classical work, free and lyrical in neoclassical work, and
      unassuming, harsh or pedestrian for modern and contemporary work. In
      addition, there are several modern varieties of dance that fuse classical
      ballet technique with contemporary dance, such as Hiplet, that require
      dancers to be practised in non-Western dance styles.[15]
